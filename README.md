# Discount-Calculator
Discount Calculator

This is a simple Python program that helps you calculate the price of an item after applying a discount. It's designed to be easy to use and prevent common input errors.

How It Works

  Enter the original price of the item.

  Enter the discount percentage you want to apply.

    The program only applies discounts 20% or higher.

    If the discount is less than 20%, the price remains the same.

    The program calculates the final price and shows it clearly.

Features

  Error Handling: If you enter something that isnâ€™t a number, the program will politely ask you to try again.

  Simple logic: Only discounts of 20% or more actually reduce the price.
